# Python_TTY_Fix_Shell
Change standard bind / reverse shell while exploiting into interactive shell.

You have managed to find an exploit and spawned either a Bind Shell or a Reverse Shell Connect Back to your machine (Kudos)
(I.E you use netcat to a bind or have something connect to a listening instance of netcat)

However it will not allow you to run sudo, nano or various other commands and is very limited.

This is a reference mainly for myself to come back to while completing CTF or VirtualMachine related challenges.

I will not be held responsible for anything you use this for, it is simply a learning resource.
